# User Guide Document
**IMPORTANT NOTE AFTER REVIEW** A user guide is something else than what is presented here. A user guide shows the user how to use a software product, how to use its visual elements, how to understand the messages sent by the web application in the interface, how to act when is not happening what it expects. The user does not install, configure, test, deploy, backup or restore the web application Think a user using the google email. You should deliver the information for the user not for the admins, testers, developers, etc.
